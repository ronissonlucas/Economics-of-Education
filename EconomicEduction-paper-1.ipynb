    "#### General Issues\n",
    "* One of the most important ideas in labor economics is to think of the set of marketable skills of workers as a form of capital in which workers make a variety of investments.\n",
    "* Loosely speaking, human capital corresponds to any stock of knowledge or characteristics the worker has (either innate or acquired) that contributes to his or her “productivity”.\n",
    "* This definition is broad, and this has both advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "*  The advantages are clear: it enables us to think of not only the years of schooling, but also of a variety of other characteristics as part of human capital investments. These include school quality, training, attitudes towards work, etc.\n",
    "* Disadvantages: At some level, we can push this notion of human capital too far, and think of every difference in remuneration that we observe in the labor market as due to human capital.\n",
    "* But, we have an important element that needs to be accounted into our models: unobserved heterogeneity.\n",
    "* The assumption that all pay differences are related to skills is a good point to start a conceptual structure on empirical modeling. Nevertheless,  we have many notable exceptions that we will discuss here in this presentation. \n",
